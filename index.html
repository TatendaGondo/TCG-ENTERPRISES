    <h2> MISSION</h2>
<p>Our mission is to create a website that will be able to link and connect consumers and suppliers of products country wide. It will have information about the products that will be supplied in your local area like food groceries, clothes, gardgets and anything you may like. Its sort of like an ebay where the suppliers meets the customers, but it will be done in a small geographical area.  </p>
